This is a project to gain more experience and deeper knowledge of signal processing and software defined radios. 

The goal of this project is to make a tool which can generate and analyze signals of various parameters, apply various DSP algorithms and see their effect, and see the effects of various effects of transmission.

Please feel free to email me with comments or ideas for improvement.
